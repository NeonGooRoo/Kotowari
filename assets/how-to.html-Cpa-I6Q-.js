This method is called immersion.</p><p>The first scientist to popularize such approach to language learning is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Krashen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stephen Krashen</a>.

I&#39;ll show you how to learn Japanese by quickly looking up words and making flashcards from any content you consume. Examples below:</p>',6)),n(s,{src:"/imgvid/JLdemo.mp4"}),n(s,{src:"/imgvid/MPVdemo.mp4"}),e[39]||(e[39]=r('<hr><h3 id="core-principles" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#core-principles"><span>Core Principles</span></a></h3><ul><li><p>When learning a new language, we should understand how we ourselves learned our native tongue and how Japanese people learned Japanese. This is achieved mostly through a huge amount of language consumption in its various manifestations, in other words - <strong>&quot;immersion&quot;</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Immersion should take up most of the time you spend learning the language and it should bring you as much enjoyment as possible. There&#39;s no need to try to learn what you&#39;re not interested in. Put textbooks aside, enjoy and relax consuming the media. Yes, it will be difficult at first, but over time, it will require less and less effort and more and more opportunities will be available.</p></li><li><p>Immersion provides a better understanding of the language than textbooks. As Panates said:</p></li></ul><blockquote><p>The average 6-year-old Spanish child has more information about the Spanish language in their head than in all the books about Spanish published in the last 200 years.</p></blockquote><p>This doesn&#39;t mean that you shouldn&#39;t use any theoretical material for language learning at all; it means that you don&#39;t need to get carried away in them, hoping to perfectly understand the language. Nobody ever did and you won&#39;t too.</p><ul><li><p>Interaction with the language occurs mainly in two forms: <strong>Input</strong> (e.g., listening, reading) and <strong>Output</strong> (e.g., speaking, writing). In the beginning (and as long as you can), you should spend time only on <strong>Input</strong>, because <strong>Output</strong> comes mostly by itself and doesn&#39;t help you to understand the language. &quot;What is this nonsense?&quot; - you might ask, but that&#39;s how it is. After thousands of hours media consumption in a new language, your brain subconsciously adapts to the structures of the new language and begins to understand how, what, and when to speak. At the same time, this will be much more natural than what textbooks or universities force you to pull out of yourself in the early stages of learning. Of course, you will still need to practice speech to speak fluently, but it will be a relatively easy and smooth process with enough input behind you. If you need to learn to speak as quickly as possible, you can try speaking from the very first day, but it will be much more difficult and there is a high risk of developing bad habits.</p></li><li><p>Input can and should be as <strong>conscious</strong> as possible, meaning that you understand most of what you are consuming and/or try to understand. Of course, at first this will be especially difficult, but it should not demotivate you from immersing. Find media that uses easier language, re-watch what you have already watched and remember well. But it is also important to try to understand what you are consuming. Simply putting a podcast in the background while working for 8 hours is not the same as 8 hours of conscious, thoughtful reading. You need to try to understand and pay attention to the media. That&#39;s why it&#39;s so important to consume what interests you. Just putting anime in the background while you study is not immersion. Yes, I further advise listening to podcasts in the background of chores, but these should not be chores that heavily occupy your mind, and it is still less effective than if you are focused specifically on immersion. Focused immersion &gt; language in the background &gt; nothing. By the way, it is impossible to learn a language in your sleep, so sleep normally.</p></li><li><p>You should strive for <strong>i+1 during immersion</strong> to maximize productivity. What is that? From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_hypothesis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia</a>:</p></li></ul><blockquote><p>&quot;input hypothesis&quot;: according to it, learners improve their knowledge of the language when they understand language input that is slightly beyond their current level. Krashen called this input level &quot;i+1&quot;, where &quot;i&quot; meant language input and &quot;+1&quot; meant the next stage of language acquisition.</p></blockquote><p>Simply put, <strong>i+1</strong> is when in a given sentence, only one language unit (word/grammar/something else) is unknown to you. For example, you probably understand what &quot;I am eating a sandwich&quot; means in English - it&#39;s a completely understandable sentence. But if you encounter &quot;I am eating natto&quot;, this would be an <strong>i+1</strong> sentence (assuming you don&#39;t know what onigiri is, but this is just an example). The more sentences you encounter that are <strong>i+1</strong>, the more productive the learning process is. And on this example it&#39;s obvious why <strong>i+1</strong> is so good, form the context you can deduct yourself that an &quot;natto&quot; is probably a food!</p><figure><img src="'+u+'" alt="" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>',9)),t("ul",null,[e[2]||(e[2]=t("li",null,[t("p",null,"Japanese should become a part of your life, but it should not overwhelm you.

What is this bullsh*t?&quot;</strong><br> The norm does not mean good. In recent years, language learning through immersion has been gaining momentum, as more and more academics are starting to talk about it. For example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Krashen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steven Krashen</a> - a linguist who talked about the input method of learning in the 1970s, as well as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Kaufmann" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steve Kaufmann</a>, a great polyglot, speaks precisely about this approach. And in general, the online language learning community (mostly English-speaking) is currently using this approach en masse, as people, after trying it, realize that it really is more fun and effective. In other countries and especially academia this approach is still not very popular, which is why this site was created to help explain and popularize this method.</p><h3 id="how-to-start-learning-japanese" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#how-to-start-learning-japanese"><span>How to Start Learning Japanese</span></a></h3><h4 id="kana" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#kana"><span>Kana</span></a></h4><p>First of all, you need to learn Hiragana and Katakana. These are two syllabaries that are used for the same sounds but have different applications. Like kanji, you don&#39;t need to try to write them from memory; you just need to remember the reading, but you can write them for fun. They will be covered in the guides.<br><img src="'+y+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><div class="hint-container caution"><p class="hint-container-title">DO NOT USE TRANSLITERATION</p><p>It&#39;s hard to imagine a worse beginner&#39;s mistake. The Japanese sound system is very different from English and probably from almost any other language, so writing words in English letters will cause false associations and lead to mistakes. Do not use materials with transliteration - this is a red flag. Learn the Kana first.</p></div><h4 id="sound-system" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#sound-system"><span>Sound System</span></a></h4><p>You need to understand that Japanese does not sound like Russian at all, so you need to pay attention to this right away. There&#39;s no need to try to repeat the kana out loud with a terrible Russian accent, reinforcing that accent. Watch videos for beginners on HOW natives pronounce sounds, not Russians who have lived in Tokyo for 2 years. Here&#39;s a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p9Il_j0zjc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">good video</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WH0UX5oQVzM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another one</a> from <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFGs3d9SobfjnhB_jcG7YLb1SZiD8yUZk&amp;si=tiDkOuSX5SJ3RDHr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a pronunciation playlist</a>. At the beginning of content consumption, pay close attention to the sounds and how they are pronounced. It will be especially useful to watch shows with real actors.</p><p>You also need to pay attention to Pitch (also called Pitch Accent, tonal accent, musical stress, or whatever it&#39;s called in Russian). This is not the same as Russian stress, and not the same as Chinese - it&#39;s a different system that combines both of these phenomena. Stress in Russian occurs due to loudness and duration of the syllable, while in Japanese, stress occurs due to a change in pitch of a certain syllable (hence the name &quot;musical tone&quot;), whereas in Chinese, the tones are different in each syllable. You don&#39;t need to torture yourself and try to memorize every pitch of every word, but you shouldn&#39;t ignore them either. Many words may sound the same if you don&#39;t distinguish pitch, and your speech will sound very unnatural.</p><p>There is a long course on pitch by Dogen <a href="https://github.com/daigakulounge/ochinchingadaiskinandayo/blob/master/dogen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> <strong>[E]</strong></p><h4 id="grammar" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#grammar"><span>Grammar</span></a></h4><p>There are 2 main paths: learning from textbooks or from &quot;guides&quot;. The immersion approach is very negative towards learning through textbooks for the following reasons:</p><ol><li>Classic textbooks often either provide too much theoretical information that beginners don&#39;t need (e.g. Nechaeva), or oversimplify everything (e.g. Minna).</li><li>Classic textbooks very slowly introduce new information, giving lots of exercises, the completion of which is weakly transferable to the real language.</li><li>Textbooks are limited in how much information they provide about various aspects of the language. Textbooks may teach you to take tests like the JLPT faster, but they are worse at helping you understand real, practical language.</li><li>Textbooks give a false sense of your level of language understanding. Many finish N3/N2 textbooks, understand everything in them, and think they have a very high level. This is not the case. This overconfidence leads to a lot of adjusting the logic of the language to suit your distorted view.</li></ol><p>As a result, you can use textbooks without dwelling too much on explanations and skipping exercises, but why not use grammar guides instead?</p><p>There is also a type of person who learns at university/school, to which two more problems are added:</p><ol><li>Learning a language in a group is very ineffective because people pick up different things at different speeds, everyone is forced to learn the same amount of time, or the group&#39;s productivity drops significantly due to the difference in level.</li><li>Textbooks and (especially) universities usually force you to learn handwriting from memory, which is an almost useless skill for understanding Japanese and being able to express yourself in it in the 24th year of the 21st century.</li></ol><p>Based on the arguments above, I believe that the optimal options are grammar guides/databases. In the Russian segment, there is one main option: <a href="https://vandal.sdf-eu.org/JapaneseGuide/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tae Kim&#39;s Guide</a> translated into Russian. It contains all the information necessary for a beginner. There are some mistakes, but they are not critical. You don&#39;t need to perceive the information you encounter anywhere as absolute truth; be prepared to sometimes change and correct your understanding of certain concepts in another language.</p><p>There is also the site <a href="http://www.nippon-gatari.info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nippon Gatari</a> - a warehouse of grammar, organized by levels. If you don&#39;t know English, it&#39;s the only good option I know of with quite a lot of information. But don&#39;t be afraid to Google topics you don&#39;t understand, there&#39;s always a chance to find a different, more understandable explanation. Don&#39;t get attached to a single source.</p><p>If you know English, there are as many as 3 (4) good options.

Simply. Kanji almost never needs to be understood out of the context of words. Kanji are used to write words, so you need to learn words in their kanji form. For example:</p><p><strong>日本 [にほん]</strong> - a word consisting of 2 kanji. To learn it, you don&#39;t need to &quot;know&quot; the kanji <strong>日</strong> and <strong>本</strong>.</p><p>You simply try to remember its reading <strong>[にほん]</strong> and its meaning - Japan. This will be very convenient to do with flashcards.</p><p>&quot;Why not learn the kanji first, then the word?&quot;</p><p>Because it&#39;s less effective. You don&#39;t need to try to memorize kanji separately. It&#39;s a skill of little use when learning a real language. When Japanese people see <strong>日本</strong>, they don&#39;t think of this word as &quot;sun base&quot; or something like that; they only have one concept in their head - Japan. From childhood, they first learn the spoken form of the word, and then add the kanji. In our case, we simply learn the kanji form simultaneously with its &quot;phonetic&quot; form, which is relatively close to how the Japanese learn words. Of course, ideally, you can learn the word without kanji first, and then add the kanji, which will probably even help with listening comprehension, but in my opinion, that&#39;s just extra hassle.</p><p>I&#39;ve heard various nonsense about this, some say that when the Japanese hear a word, they break it down by composition and then get the meaning from its composition. This is just nonsense. They don&#39;t break down words like <strong>いなずま</strong>, and then imagine <strong>稲妻</strong> in their heads and rack their brains over what it means &quot;rice-wife&quot;. Just as you, when you hear the word &quot;паровоз&quot; (steam locomotive), don&#39;t think that it&#39;s a vehicle that carries steam. The specific type of transport that we refer to as &quot;паровоз&quot; immediately appears in your head.</p><p>Yes, learning words as combinations of kanji is fun, interesting, and fashionable, but it only works at the beginning when textbooks specifically give you words that are easily perceived through such logic. In the real world, one kanji can have several basic meanings, dozens of readings, and other subtleties that will simply break your head when memorizing words that don&#39;t fit within your understanding when using this method. Over time, the approach of learning without memorizing kanji will bring you more and more benefits, because you will encounter more and more words with unique or rare kanji. For example, words like <strong>薔薇</strong> will be easily remembered thanks to their uniqueness.</p><p>Actually knowing kanji may only be useful if you want to pass exams where you need to write by hand (a useless skill in the real world), or if there is a part with a kanji test where you need to distinguish 成績 or 成積 (a useless skill in the real world, because in practice there are very few such similar words and it&#39;s easier to understand the difference in specific cases).</p>",9)),t("p",null,[e[20]||(e[20]=o("If you want to learn to write in Japanese, check out ")),n(a,{to:"/guide/handwriting.html"},{default:i(()=>e[19]||(e[19]=[o("this guide with information")])),_:1})]),e[42]||(e[42]=r("<p>Over time, words with new and especially unique kanji will be something interesting and easy for you to remember, compared to yet another word-combination of old, familiar kanji.

More than anything, I recommend consuming visual content at the beginning, simpler anime and dramas is perfect. YouTube will be usually too difficult in the beginning, but if you&#39;re interested in it, it&#39;s amazing.</p><p>Don&#39;t read at first, but don&#39;t forget about it.</p><p>Reading allows you to consume much more language per unit of time than listening, so the more you read, the more effectively you learn. For starters, manga may be the optimal option, try different media, different styles, different genres, everything until you find something interesting. Ideally, maintain a balance of reading and listening, but of course, something will interest you more, something less, so try not to completely neglect any part of the language.</p><p>Try to fill all your free time with Japanese. 4 intervals of 15 minutes during the day that you would have wasted on VK - that&#39;s an hour of Japanese you missed. Over a year, that&#39;s 365 hours of Japanese. Maybe even enough for JLPT N5. Put podcasts or Condensed Audio in the background of other tasks. It&#39;s not full immersion, but it&#39;s better than nothing. MUSIC won&#39;t work!
